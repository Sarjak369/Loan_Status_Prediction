# Loan_Status_Prediction


I recently completed a Machine Learning Project where I created Multiple Models to Predict whether the loan will be approved or not. 🏦💸

Project: Looan Status Prediction

In this project, We need to solve the Loan Approval Prediction. This is a Classification problem in which we need to classify whether the Loan will be approved or not.

Problem Statement:

Automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.
